# pc-setup

This is the set of scripts I use for post-installation setup of Debian 11 for personal computer use.

It almost definitely isn't applicable to you, but it is useful for me to keep this on public GitHub
so that I can clone the repo from a new computer and run it to get about 70% of the way set up.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KNOXDEV/pc-setup
cd pc-setup && ./setup.sh
```

This does have the inadvertently have the effect of documenting the software I use. Feel free to poke around.
